##Variables

Using the smartphone's embedded accelermoter and gyroscope, volunteers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.
For the purposes of this project, measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted from the original data set for each measurement.
